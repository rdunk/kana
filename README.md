# Kana

A simple app to practice reading hiragana and katakana, the two syllabaries used to write Japanese morae.

You can find it online at [kana.party](https://kana.party).

## Run locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Future progress

The libraries of words currently used are pretty basic and could do with improving and expanding. The application currently loads them in their entirety from JSON into memory, which might not be sensible if they get too large.

It would be nice to have some feedback, statistics, etc.

Feel free to submit PRs if interested in contributing.
